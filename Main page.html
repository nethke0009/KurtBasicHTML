     <font face="Cascadia Code" size="4" color="white">Heya, I'm <b>Kurt Gabriel L. Datuin</b>, i'm currently studying at San Jose Ang Tagapagtanggol Parochial school, a decent school which I hold dearly to my heart, as ive been with the school for almost a decade now. This would be the location where i'd find friends, close friends, and where I would learn to love the art of mathematics. At a young age, I was never really keen with the concept of mathematics, with such concepts
    never really clicking in my mind. For years, ive had a hard time in trying to understand, but subsequently never would. But as of recent, something would change,
    as I grew older, all would suddenly click, and now all of a sudden, I have an absurd love for mathematics.

    <br>
    <br> 
    With that in mind, the entire purpose of this website is to just document all the information in mathematics that ive acquired <i>(With most probably being wrong)</i> throughout the years.
    <br> <i>(and maybe show some math problems along the way)</i>
